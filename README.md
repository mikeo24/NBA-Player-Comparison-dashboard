## NBA-Player-Comparison-dashboard

###  Project Description
I created a dashboard for NBA players with the top 15 Player Efficiency Rating (PER) using Tableau. I scraped advanced stats and PER stats from Basketball Reference website and cleaned the data using Python. I then joined the datasets scraped together while sorting the data by PER and ascending while filtering the players who played 30 minutes or more per game. The dynamic dashboard was able to visualize the data based on the PER statistic, as well as player’s name, team, and position. Furthermore, I used Tableau’s drag and drop feature to create a color-coded visualization of the data, allowing viewers to easily identify key players. The final dashboard was successful in displaying the data in an accessible and attractive way.

### Data Cleaning 
Dealing with duplicate rows especially the ones that been traded up during a specific season as they mught have multiple team within it. Remove all the missing data after our merge and making sure that every column has the same data type "Float64" Data exploration. Combining Advanced and PER datasets on player and year which are the common columns from both datasets. Create a new file with the top 15 Players based on PER.
